# Christofer Diep Portfolio

I am a electrical engineer graduating 2027.

*Lab 1 part 1
Lab 1, part 1 I believe was one of my favorite labs because it was teh start of everything and my platform of experiencing C++. We learned the few basic words of C++. But the thing I like about this was that we were all in this together as partners understanding the assignments.

*Lab 2 part 2
Lab 2, part 2 I really liked how cool when you type something down it adds more to it. For example when you typed out cat it would just add cats knowing what to put down. When doing this code it really taught me that I had to go slower and not really speed run coding for it will make you do so much work at the end.

* Lab 11 part 1-2
Lab 11, part 1 and 2 I believe that this assignment must have been the top of my favorite list. I loved this one the most because my partner really taught me how to be a better coder teaching me the ins and outs of this. The thing this code really taught me was how to find linter problems and also help me find out what typing errors I had.
